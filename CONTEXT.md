# WoW System - Full Context & Background

**Created**: October 1, 2025
**Author**: Chude <chude@emeke.org>
**Purpose**: Rebuild WoW System v4.1 after accidental deletion

## üéØ What This Project Is

The **Ways of Working (WoW) System** is an advanced enforcement and intelligence layer for Claude Code that ensures adherence to development best practices through hooks, behavioral tracking, and intelligent guidance.

It's designed to **enforce** your personal development principles by intercepting Claude LLM's actions in real-time and ensuring compliance with your "Ways of Working".

## üìñ Historical Context

### The Journey

**v1.0 (Conceptual)** - Early 2025
- Basic idea: Remind Claude about WoW principles
- Manual enforcement through CLAUDE.md

**v2.0 (Basic Hooks)** - September 2025
- Introduced Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, PreToolUse, Stop)
- Manual compliance checking scripts
- Bash-based enforcement
- Location: `/mnt/c/Users/Destiny/.claude/scripts/`

**v3.5.0 (Context-Aware)** - September 13-14, 2025
- Real-time scoring system (0-100 with letter grades)
- Streak tracking (consecutive compliant operations)
- Trust levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Auto-fix git commits (remove emojis, add author)
- Session reports
- TRUE BLOCKING of dangerous operations
- Location: `/mnt/c/Users/Destiny/.claude/wow-system/`

**v4.0 (Intelligent Scoring)** - September 14-17, 2025
- Selective blocking strategy (warnings vs hard blocks)
- Intelligent ratio-based scoring
  - ECR (Edit/Create Ratio): Measures edit vs create behavior
  - VR (Violation Rate): Percentage of rule violations
- Pattern detection and trend analysis
- Visual dashboard with actionable feedback
- Time-weighted metrics (recent behavior matters more)
- Location: `/mnt/c/Users/Destiny/.claude/wow-system/`

**v4.0.2 (Lost)** - September 17-30, 2025
- Close to production-ready
- Comprehensive hook system
- 19 modular bash scripts:
  - `wow-core.sh`, `wow-loader.sh`, `wow-orchestrator.sh`
  - `wow-enforcer.sh`, `wow-bash-filter.sh`, `wow-write-handler.sh`, `wow-handler-factory.sh`
  - `wow-intelligent-analyzer.sh`, `wow-scoring-strategy.sh`
  - `wow-memory-bridge.sh`, `wow-storage-adapter.sh`
  - `wow-session-hook.sh`, `wow-session-tracker.sh`, `wow-prompt-hook.sh`
  - `wow-banner.sh`, `wow-summary.sh`, `wow-quick-check.sh`
  - `wow-config-reader.sh`, `wow-version.sh`
- **Status**: Accidentally deleted September 30, 2025

## üíî What Happened - The Deletion

### The Incident

**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Cause**: WSL2 command `rm -rf /mnt/c/Users/Destiny/.claude/` executed while troubleshooting Claude Code login issues
**Loss**: Entire WoW v4.0.2 system (19 bash scripts, settings.json, hooks configuration)

### Why It Was Lost Forever

- WSL2 `rm -rf` command **bypasses Windows Recycle Bin**
- No git repository backup (scripts were only in `.claude` folder, not version controlled)
- No GitHub backup (never pushed separately)
- AI-Dev-Environment repo only had documentation, not actual script files

### What Was Recoverable

‚úÖ **Documentation**:
- v3.5.0 README with feature descriptions
- v4.0 IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md with design details
- WOW-COMPLIANCE.md with organizational principles
- v3.5.0 settings.json with hook configurations

‚ùå **Not Recoverable**:
- Actual bash script implementations
- Complete v4.0.2 codebase
- Working settings.json for v4.0

---

## üèóÔ∏è Why This Project Exists Now

### The New Architecture Decision

**Previous Mistake**: WoW system lived inside `.claude` folder
- ‚ùå Not version controlled
- ‚ùå Lost when `.claude` was deleted
- ‚ùå Coupled to AI-Dev-Environment project

**New Strategy**: WoW system as standalone project
- ‚úÖ Independent git repository
- ‚úÖ Proper project structure
- ‚úÖ Can be pushed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Deployed to `.claude` via symlink
- ‚úÖ Safe from accidental deletion (source in Projects folder)

### The Deployment Model

```
SOURCE (Development):
/Projects/wow-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    ‚Üê Development happens here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                   ‚Üê Version control
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/deploy.sh       ‚Üê Deployment automation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

RUNTIME (Production):
/mnt/c/Users/Destiny/.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json           ‚Üê Copied from wow-system/config/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wow-system/             ‚Üê Symlink to /Projects/wow-system/src/
```

**Benefits**:
- Edit source in Projects ‚Üí Changes immediately reflected (symlink)
- Delete `.claude`? ‚Üí Just redeploy! Source is safe
- Can push to GitHub for backup
- Proper separation of concerns

## üéØ Core WoW Principles Being Enforced

### 1. **Edit > Create** (Edit-First Philosophy)
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Prevents file proliferation
- Encourages consolidation
- **Metric**: ECR (Edit/Create Ratio) should be > 2.0

### 2. **Clean Root Directory**
- Only essential files in project root
- Everything else in organized folders
- **Whitelist**: README.md, LICENSE, package.json, START-HERE.md, config files

### 3. **Git Commit Quality**
- ‚ùå No emojis in commit messages
- ‚úÖ Proper author: `Chude <chude@emeke.org>`
- ‚úÖ Meaningful commit messages (focus on "why" not "what")

### 4. **Enterprise-Grade Standards**
- No MVP, no POC - production-ready only
- Comprehensive error handling
- Systems thinking approach
- Evidence-based decisions

### 5. **Safety First**
- Block dangerous operations (`rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`)
- Warn on risky actions (writing to system paths)
- Protect critical files

## üìä What v4.0.2 Could Do

### Real-Time Enforcement
- **SessionStart**: Initialize state, display WoW banner
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Show current score, streak, violations
- **PreToolUse**: Intercept Write, Edit, Bash operations before execution
- **Stop**: Display session report with final metrics

### Intelligent Scoring
```
Base Score: 70 points
+ ECR Bonus: Up to +30 (higher edit/create ratio)
- Violation Penalty: Up to -20 (based on violation %)
= Final Score: 0-100 with letter grade (A+ to F)
```

### Selective Blocking
- **Hard Block**: Dangerous operations (system file changes, destructive commands)
- **Warning**: Root folder writes (allowed but penalized -3 points)
- **Gentle Reminder**: Normal creates (allowed, -1 point)
- **Praise**: Edits (encouraged, improves ECR)

### Pattern Detection
- Trend analysis (improving/stable/degrading)
- Streak tracking (consecutive compliant operations)
- Trust level calculation
- Actionable feedback ("Need 1 more edit for grade A")

## üöÄ What We're Building Now

### WoW System v4.1

**Goals**:
1. Rebuild v4.0.2 functionality from documentation
2. Leverage Claude Code v2.0.1 new features
3. Improve architecture (extensible, loosely coupled, tightly integrated)
4. Add comprehensive UX/UI
5. Strengthen security
6. Make it production-ready

**Philosophy** (Anthropic + Apple Approach):
- **Anthropic**: Systematic, thorough, evidence-based, safety-first
- **Apple**: Elegant UX, attention to detail, "just works", delightful interactions

**Separation of Concerns**:
- `core/` - State management, session lifecycle
- `handlers/` - Tool interception (Bash, Write, Edit)
- `hooks/` - Hook implementations (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, etc.)
- `strategies/` - Scoring algorithms, pattern detection
- `storage/` - Persistence layer
- `ui/` - Banners, reports, visual feedback
