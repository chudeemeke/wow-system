# WoW Compliance - Project Organization

## Applied WoW Principles

This project has been organized according to your enterprise project organization principles:

### Clean Root Directory ✅
Only essential files in root:
- `START-HERE.md` - Entry point for users
- `README.md` - Primary documentation  
- `LICENSE` - Legal requirement
- Configuration files (when added)

### Proper Directory Structure ✅
```
├── docs/           # All documentation organized
├── scripts/        # All executable scripts
├── src/            # Source code with clear modules
├── tests/          # Test suite with proper structure
├── plugins/        # Extension point
└── examples/       # Usage examples
```

### Documentation Organization ✅
- User guides in `docs/guides/`
- Technical docs in `docs/`
- Contributing guide moved to `docs/`
- Project summary moved to `docs/`

### Script Organization ✅
- `install.sh` moved to `scripts/`
- `install.bat` moved to `scripts/`
- Future scripts will go in `scripts/`

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Discoverability**: Users immediately see START-HERE.md
2. **Clarity**: No confusion about where to find things
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Professionalism**: Enterprise-grade structure
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components

## Global Memory Update

Your WoW principles have been updated in CLAUDE.md to include:

```markdown
### 4. Enterprise Project Organization
- Root folder: Only README.md, LICENSE, START-HERE.md, and config files
- All documentation in docs/ directory
- All scripts in scripts/ directory
- Source code in src/ with clear module separation
- Tests in tests/ with unit/integration structure
- No clutter in root - organize by purpose
```

This principle will now be applied to all future projects automatically.

## Future Projects

When creating new projects, this structure will be the default:
- Clean root with only essential files
- Proper directory organization from the start
- Clear separation of documentation, scripts, and source
- Enterprise-grade architecture
